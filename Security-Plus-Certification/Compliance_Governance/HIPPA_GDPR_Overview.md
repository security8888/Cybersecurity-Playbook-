Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was signed into United States federal law in 1996.

HIPPA compliance relies on adherence to a range of rules regarding privacy, security, breach notification, enforcement and transaction standards.  Organizations must notify affected individuals, the HHS and the media within 60 days of discovering a PHI breach.  Breaches that affect fewer than 500 individuals may be reported annually.
