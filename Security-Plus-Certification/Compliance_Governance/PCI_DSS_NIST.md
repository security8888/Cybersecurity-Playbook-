NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a framework that offers classification of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can be utilized by organizations to strengthen understanding, assessment, prioritization and communication of the organizations cybersecurity efforts.  CSF applies to industry, government agencies, academia and non-profit organizations of any size and maturity-level.  NISTs focal points are governance and risk management strategies, implementation of safeguards for protecting assets, continuous monitoring for threats, incidence response, and guaranteeing recovery processes.  These focal points must align with legal, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity policies.  If an organization does not comply with CSF indirect consequences could occur from legal or regulatory agencies that incorporate NIST standards.  

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed and maintained PCI Security Standards Council to provide protection to payment data through the payment lifecycle.  PCI-DSS are mandatory global standards that apply to all organizations the store, process or transmit cardholder data. Compliance requirements include securing networks with firewalls, encrypting payment data, and protecting stored cardholder data.  Stringent access controls and authentication mechanisms must be in place.  An organization must regularly monitor and test networks, address vulnerabilities and maintain a comprehensive security policy for all personnel. In lieu of a breach supervisors need to be notified immediately after detection of a breach, cooperation with an independent PFI forensic investigation, adherence to evidence preservation protocols and submission of mandatory reports to payment brands and acquirers.  Penalties for non-compliance vary.  Fines of $5,000 to $100,000 per month, potential loss of merchant privileges and liability for breach-related damages.

National Security Agencyâ€™s (NSA) National Cross Domain Strategy and Management Office (NCDSMO) Raise the Bar (RTB) was introduced in 2018. It was created to improve cybersecurity of all cross-domain solutions by setting several stringent controls that organizations must adhere to when shipping software to government networks.  RTB compliance includes implementation of advanced cybersecurity measures such as multifactor authentication, strong encryption, privileged access restrictions and continuous monitoring of classified and sensitive systems.  Organizations must secure their supply chains and create strong incident response capabilities.  In lieu of a breach organizations must comply to federal incident reporting timeframes and protocols, notify supervisors immediately when a breach is detected that affects classified or sensitive systems.  RTB is a voluntary framework so there is not a standard penalty for lack of compliance. 

The Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) is a voluntary framework created by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to help organizations adopt zero trust principles.  ZTMM is primarily targeted at U.S. federal agencies, as mandated by Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity. However, it has also been widely referenced by private organizations and state/local governments looking to adopt zero trust principles.  ZTMM provides a roadmap for implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) across five pillars: Identity, Device, Network/Environment, Application/Workload, and Data. This includes enforcing multifactor authentication and role-based access controls for identity management, ensuring device health monitoring and endpoint protection, segmenting networks and encrypting data in transit, securing application access and workload integrity, and implementing least-privilege access with robust encryption for sensitive data. Continuous monitoring and verification are essential at every stage to align with zero trust principles.  Organizations adopting zero trust principles are expected to integrate breach reporting processes into their security and governance strategies.
