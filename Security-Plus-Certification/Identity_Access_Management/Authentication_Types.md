Password-based authentication is the most common and simplest method of authentication. In a “professional” setting a password could be a combination of username-password, passcode or pin.  This authentication method is the easiest to exploit because of human errors such as choosing simple passwords or using the same one for multiple accounts.  It is best to enforce strong password policies such as regular changes and complexity requirements.
Two-factor authentication/multi-factor authentication (MFA) usually involves a password, first factor, and an additional layer of security, second factor.  An example of this process could be a one-time password sent through email or SMS in conjunction with a fingerprint scan.
Biometric authentication uses a unique physical attributes like facial recognition, iris tracking or fingerprint scanning.  This authentication method offers the most security.
