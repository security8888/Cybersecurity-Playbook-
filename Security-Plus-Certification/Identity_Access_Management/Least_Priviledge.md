Least Privilege access model is principle that ensures users, processes and devices are given the minimum permissions necessary to complete their tasks.

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) reserves control over access policies to a centralized security administration.  MAC works by applying security labels to resources and users.  MAC consists of two elements: classification and clearance and compartment.  Classification and clearance is a system that defines a resources sensitivity.  A users security clearance will determine what kind of resources they can access.  Compartment describes the group of people allowed access to a resource.  A users compartment defines the group or groups they participate in.

Discretionary Access Control reserves control over security decisions to the owners of the resource.  DAC uses access control lists (ACLs) to define who can access a resource.  The ACLs pair users and group identifiers with their access privileges.  For each resource you own you can set read/write privileges and password requirements within a list of users and user groups.  

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) grants access privileges based upon the work that individual users do.  RBAC limits access to just the resources users need to do their jobs.  Using RBAC requires defining the different roles within the organization; then deciding if a user needs access to a resource and to what degree that access is. 

Zero Trust operates on the principle of “never trust, always verify”.  No user or device is trusted by default.  Resource access is granted after rigorous verification.  The session is continuously monitored.
