Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software or hardware tool that observes network or system resources for unauthorized activities.  IDS functions by performing passive scans on received network traffic.  IDS then compares the scan with the configured signatures of the network.  IDS is looking for inconsistencies that could indicate a potential security breach.  IDS will generate alerts to tell administrators what is occurring.  IDS does not take any active measures to stop the threats from occurring.

Intrusive Prevention System (IPS) works almost entirely the same way IDS works.  The difference being, when IPS performs the scan and detects a potential threat to the network, it will block or neutralize the threat at once.
