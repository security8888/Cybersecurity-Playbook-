Network Firewalls are used to prevent private networks from unauthorized access.  The firewall monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing traffic of the network. 

Packet Filters monitor outgoing and incoming packets.  These packets will either be allowed to travel through the network or will not be based on the IP addresses, protocols and ports being used by the packets. 

Stateful Inspection Firewalls is another packet filter.  These firewalls know if a packet belongs to a particular session or not.  It only allows communication if the session is perfectly established between two endpoints. 

Application Layer Firewalls examine application layer data.  For example, an HTTP request.  If the firewall finds a suspicious application, the firewall will block it immediately. 

Next-Generation Firewalls can do all the things previously mentioned firewalls can do with additional features such as application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention and cloud-delivered threat intelligence.

Circuit-Level Gateways provides User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection security.

Software Firewall is operated using a computer.  This firewall protects the computer from external attacks.  

Hardware Firewall is a physical device used to enforce a network boundary.  All network links will cross through this firewall.  This allows the firewall to inspect inbound and outbound traffic and to enforce access controls and other security policies.

Cloud Firewall protects a network from unauthorized access by filtering data at a cloud level.

Firewall Configuration is incredibly important.  First you must secure the firewall.  Next you must establish firewall zones and IP address structure.  Next configure access control lists, other firewall services and logging.  
Once that is all done you will want to test the firewall configuration.  Finally you want to monitor the firewall configuration regularly.
