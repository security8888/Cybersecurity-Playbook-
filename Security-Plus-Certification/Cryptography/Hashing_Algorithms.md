Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) is a cryptographic hash function algorithm that creates a 128-bit (16-byte) fixed-length message from an input message of any length.  Vulnerabilities have been discovered since MD5s creation.  It is now used for non-cryptographic functions such as checksum.  Checksum creates a small block of data from a larger block of data.  Checksum helps in detecting errors that could have occurred during storage or transmission.  A packet header has a checksum. 
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is a family of cryptographic hash functions.  SHA-256 is used most today as its predecessors have vulnerabilities.  SHA-256 takes an input message of any length or size and creates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.  SHA-256 is used for Message Authentication Codes (MAC), digital signatures, and password hashing. 
Bcrypt is a password-hashing function used to securely hash passwords.  Bcrypt accepts a password string up to 72-bytes, a numeric cost and salt value of 16 bytes (128 bits).  In most cases the salt is an arbitrary number.  Bcrypt takes these inputs and calculates a 24-byte (192-bit) hash.
