Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code.  There are two types of encryption used in cybersecurity: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric Encryption (SE) implements the use of a key.  This key is used both for encryption and decryption.  SE is faster and more efficient when used for large amounts of data.  SE requires a secure method to share the key between the sender and receiver.  SE is used in file encryption, VPNs and secure data storage.  Common SE algorithms are AES, DES, and Blowfish. 

Asymmetric Encryption (AE) implements the use of a single key and its pendant.  One key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption.  The second key is kept secret, while the first key, also known as a public key, is accessed by all users.  AE is more secure but slower than SE.  AE is in used in digital signatures, SSL/TLS and secure email communication.  Common AE algorithms are RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman.
