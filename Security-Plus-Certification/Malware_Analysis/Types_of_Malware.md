Malware, short for malicious software, is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems.  Malware aims to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, and mobile devices.
A virus is a program or software that attaches itself to another software or computer program with the intent of harming the computer system.  A virus cannot be controlled remotely.  When a program or file that contains the virus runs, the virus will perform its functions.  A virus is self-propagating.  It will hide in other applications or documents on the computer system.  By doing this is can guarantee the infection of the entire computer system, making it easy to share with other systems.  Viruses cannot spread on their own.  A user must run the infected program or file for it to spread to other systems. The Melissa Virus spread via infected Microsoft Word documents.  The virus is attached to emails; replicating itself by sending copies to the first 50 contacts in the users address book.  The Melissa Virus led to $80 million in damages and dramatically slowed many email systems.

A worm is a single malware program that copies itself to other computers.  Worms do not have to attach themselves to other programs or files to function.  A worm will take advantage of open holes in operating systems or applications and spread by possessing the ability to fix themselves on the networks.  They will consume a vast amount of computing resources, drastically slowing the system down.  A worm will propagate through link shares, e-mail attachments or weaknesses in programs.  When a system is infected by the worm it will spread to other systems on its own.  A user does not have to interact with it for it to spread to other systems.  Some worm programs allow the attacker some form of supervisory control over the infected systems.  The Slammer worm targeted database software.  It spread so fast that it slowed down the entire internet.  It will copy itself then jump to another system.  The Slammer worm infected 75.000 systems in 10 minutes.

Trojans or trojan horses, are a type of virus that is disguised as a desirable software.  Trojans do not self-replicate.  They are installed on to a system by tricking a user into downloading it.  Once the trojan is installed it will steal important details from the system.  It creates a “backdoor” into the details of the system and what the system contains.  Key stroke monitoring will record the motions a person makes on the key, take screen shots and transfer other useful information back to the attacker.  Zeus Trojan used key stroke logging and form grabbing to steal banking information.  It spreads by unintentional download and phishing schemes.  Over 75.000 FTP accounts on websites of Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC and other companies were affected by Zeus Trojans.
