A comprehensive malware detection strategy involves multiple layers of protection.  Endpoint Protection monitors and secures all devices connected to the network by identifying and blocking known malware threats before they can infect the system.  Network security measures, like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, help prevent unauthorized access to the network and monitor network traffic for signs of suspicious activities.  Behavioral analysis identifies and blocks threats based on their actions and patterns.  Threat intelligence is collecting and analyzing information about potential threats and staying up to date on new or evolving threats.  Regular software and operating system security patch updates

There are many malware detection techniques that can be employed.  
Signature-based detection uses known digital indicators of malware to identify suspicious behavior.  Lists pf indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be used to identify a breach.  
Static file analysis entails examining a files code without running it.  File names, hashes, strings such as IP addresses, and file header data can all be evaluated to determine whether a file is malicious. 
Dynamic malware analysis involves running suspected malicious code in a safe environment called a sandbox.  The malicious code can be observed and studied in the sandbox and will have no effect on the system.
Dynamic monitoring of mass file operations uses a file integrity monitoring tool to track and analyze the integrity of file systems through both reactive forensic auditing and proactive rules-based monitoring.
File extension blocklisting is where a list of known malicious file extension types is categorized in a “blocklist” to prevent unsuspecting users from downloading or using the dangerous files. 
Application allowlisting is the opposite of blocklisting.  It is a list of approved applications.
A malware honeypot mimics a software application or application programming interface to draw out malware attacks in a controlled environment.  A honeypot file is a decoy file to draw out attackers.  Both aid the security team in developing or enhancing antimalware solutions. 
Checksumming is a calculation on a collection of data to confirm its integrity.  The most common checksum used is cyclic redundancy check (CRC).  It is an analysis of the value and position of a group of data.
Measuring changes of a files data through file entropy is used to combat evolving malware.  Attackers will create dynamic malware executables to avoid detection.  The result is a file with high entropy levels.  These levels can indicate malware is in use.
Machine learning (ML) behavioral analysis is a subset of artificial intelligence.  ML is a process of teaching algorithms to learn pattern from existing data to predict answers on new data.  This technology can analyze file behavior, identify patterns and use those insights to improve detection of unidentified malware.

It is important to choose the right malware solution for an organization.  You must keep in mind the organizations unique needs and risk profile.  Thing to keep in mind are compatibility, scalability, ease of use, support and updates and integration.
