Log Analysis is the process of reviewing computer generated event logs.  The reason for reviewing event logs is to identify bugs, security threats or other risks.  Log analysis also can be used to fulfill regulations or review user habits.  Organizations must obey specific regulations that control how data is archived and analyzed.  An event log is a comprehensive file that describes the activity occurring within an operating system, software or device.  The system administrator can configure the event log to report on any information they choose, this includes messages, error reports, file requests, file transfers and login and logout requests.  Event logs are timestamped making it easier to establish a trail of activity in lieu of a system failure, breach or other issue.  Log analysis is beneficial to an organization because it aids in troubleshooting, enhancing cybersecurity and improves a customerâ€™s experience.
