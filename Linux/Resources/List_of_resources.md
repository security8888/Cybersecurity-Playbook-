I chose to list websites that are excellent linux reference sites.  I did this because the only other resource to list is netcad and
there will be no access to that after 1 year.  I choose a list that was choosen and written by Christian Cawley.  I will be using her explanations of the websites in
this md file.

Getting started with Linux is simpler than it has ever been. Expanding that knowledge, and troubleshooting, can be tougher. Unlike Windows, you can't just ask a colleague or a 
mate down the pub. What you can do, however, is go online and find the right place to ask questions.

https://www.linuxjournal.com/

A print magazine (also available in digital formats) with a detailed website, Linux Journal has been running for over 20 years. Offering a 360-degree look at the world of Linux, this

beyond.

This simple-looking blog has been running since 2000, and regularly shares useful Linux news and how-tos. But these aren't the usual, run-of-the-mill type of articles. Sure, you'll find the latest news 
about the coolest Linux hardware (for instance, the Librem 5 phone from Purism), but hidden away in NixCraft is a collection of troubleshooting articles, along with some fringe tutorials.
